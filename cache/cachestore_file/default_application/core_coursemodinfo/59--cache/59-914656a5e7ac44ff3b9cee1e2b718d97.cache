Below you will find the assessment for the annual refresher for 2015.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt;"> As you are aware, being an Authorised Officer for the Department of Parks and  Wildlife requires skills and knowledge, to obtain compliance and safety when  dealing with a wide range of offences. It is important that you know your  powers of enforcement, how to use (or not use) them and remain safe at all  times.<br></p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">There are in the region of 400+ Authorised Officers currently, some have received training recently, some received training 5-10+ years ago. &nbsp;There are some that did not receive any training as a result of their role at that time. In the spirit of streamlining our Authorised Officer processes, and ensuring that ALL officers that are Authorised under the CALM Act 1984 have the minimum required knowledge of the legislation and their responsibilities, Regulatory Training has introduced an annual refresher.</span><br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/cards.jpg" alt="" width="741" height="155" role="presentation" style="vertical-align:middle; margin: 0 .5em;" class="img-responsive"></p><span style="font-weight: normal;">This year's refresher has been created to the lowest acceptable level of required knowledge for an Authorised Officer to demonstrate competency in. We were mindful during the creation of the varying current levels of knowledge however, any person Authorised under the CALM Act 1984 must still be able to demonstrate a minimum standard of knowledge and ability regardless of their role and reasons for requiring authorisation.</span><p></p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">In the years to follow, the refreshers will be tailored to groups and their roles. &nbsp;For example, a Wildlife Officer will have additional questions that relate to the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 and a CALM Officer with authority under the Bush Fires Act 1954 will have additional questions that relate to that act. You must pass in order to retain your  Authority.&nbsp;</span> If you have any queries or issues please contact the Regulatory Training Coordinator - <b>Kharis Johnston</b>.</p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt;"><a href="@@PLUGINFILE@@/Student%20instruction%20sheet.pdf" target="blank">Additional information for students.</a><br></p><p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 7.5pt;">
