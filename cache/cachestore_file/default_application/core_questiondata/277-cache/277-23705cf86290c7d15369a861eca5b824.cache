He often overrides her decisions even though she is always careful to follow procedures. When Chrissie tried to discuss the matter with him, he said that her work was 'shoddy' and not done the way he likes it. Chrissie is concerned that others within the department will think it's her who isn't following the proper procedures.&nbsp;</span></p><p><b>From Alan's perspective</b></p><p>Alan has been in his position for many years. He is bored with his job and feels unappreciated. He doesn't bother following departmental procedures - he just does things the way he's always done them - it gets the job done. One of his staff, Chrissie, really annoys him because she insists on following procedures to the letter. He likes her but feels threatened by her efficiency. He's worried she might get promoted over him.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: 10.5px; line-height: 0px;">Image courtesy of David Castillo Dominici / FreeDigitalPhotos.net</span><br></p><p></p>";s:18:"questiontextformat";s:1:"1";s:15:"generalfeedback";s:0:"";s:21:"generalfeedbackformat";s:1:"1";s:11:"defaultmark";d:0;s:7:"penalty";d:0;s:5:"qtype";s:11:"description";s:6:"length";s:1:"0";s:5:"stamp";s:47:"learning-uat.dpaw.wa.gov.au+150305043407+QknngJ";s:7:"version";s:47:"learning-uat.dpaw.wa.gov.au+150511072954+KcVbvk";s:6:"hidden";s:1:"0";s:11:"timecreated";s:10:"1425530047";s:12:"timemodified";s:10:"1431329394";s:9:"createdby";s:4:"2103";s:10:"modifiedby";s:4:"2103";s:9:"contextid";s:4:"2608";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":1:{s:7:"answers";a:0:{}}s:5:"hints";a:0:{}}
