She sometimes meets with interstate staff and consultants as part of her job and uses her corporate credit card to pay for meals at restaurants.&nbsp;</p><p>Two friends she went to university with are stopping overnight in Perth on their way to Indonesia for a holiday. She invites them for dinner and books an expensive restaurant. At the restaurant Tara bumps into Jason, a work colleague. She invites him to join her and her friends for dinner. He is surprised when Tara uses her corporate credit card to pay for the meal. When Jason offers to pay for his share, Tara tells him not to worry; that she's done it many times before and no one will notice as she'll just record the meal as a business meeting.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason doesn't report this misuse of public resources because he would feel uncomfortable if anyone knew it was him who reported Tara as she is well liked.</p><p style="text-align: right;"><span style="border: 0px none; font-stretch: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 10.5px; line-height: 0px;">Image courtesy of phanlop88 / FreeDigitalPhotos.net</span></span></p><p></p><p></p>";s:18:"questiontextformat";s:1:"1";s:15:"generalfeedback";s:0:"";s:21:"generalfeedbackformat";s:1:"1";s:11:"defaultmark";d:0;s:7:"penalty";d:0;s:5:"qtype";s:11:"description";s:6:"length";s:1:"0";s:5:"stamp";s:47:"learning-uat.dpaw.wa.gov.au+150511094823+ySFeCE";s:7:"version";s:47:"learning-uat.dpaw.wa.gov.au+150511094824+UhElFf";s:6:"hidden";s:1:"0";s:11:"timecreated";s:10:"1431337703";s:12:"timemodified";s:10:"1431337703";s:9:"createdby";s:4:"2103";s:10:"modifiedby";s:4:"2103";s:9:"contextid";s:4:"2608";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":1:{s:7:"answers";a:0:{}}s:5:"hints";a:0:{}}
