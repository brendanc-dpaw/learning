The hide is a major attraction for bird watchers and the reason many people travel to the sanctuary. Darren's role as Field Officer includes general maintenance of the hide. It is expected he conducts quarterly visits and logs them in the maintenance manual.</p><p>In the summer months, the track to the hide is hot and mosquito ridden. In autumn, there are too many tourists. In winter, rains cut-off road access for most of the season, so spring is the only time Darren really enjoys this part of his Field Officer role. Explaining this to Fred, a long term employee, in the staff lunchroom, Darren was surprised to hear Fred's response: "Darren, just do what every other person has done in that role. Go when the weather's good and fudge the rest of the dates. No one checks your attendance against the maintenance manual anyhow".</p><p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: 10.5px; line-height: 0px;">Image courtesy of stockimages / FreeDigitalPhotos.net</span><br></p><p></p>";s:18:"questiontextformat";s:1:"1";s:15:"generalfeedback";s:0:"";s:21:"generalfeedbackformat";s:1:"1";s:11:"defaultmark";d:0;s:7:"penalty";d:0;s:5:"qtype";s:11:"description";s:6:"length";s:1:"0";s:5:"stamp";s:47:"learning-uat.dpaw.wa.gov.au+150511090635+q9v1qG";s:7:"version";s:47:"learning-uat.dpaw.wa.gov.au+150512050446+Rr20hK";s:6:"hidden";s:1:"0";s:11:"timecreated";s:10:"1431335195";s:12:"timemodified";s:10:"1431407086";s:9:"createdby";s:4:"2103";s:10:"modifiedby";s:4:"2103";s:9:"contextid";s:4:"2608";s:7:"options";O:8:"stdClass":1:{s:7:"answers";a:0:{}}s:5:"hints";a:0:{}}
